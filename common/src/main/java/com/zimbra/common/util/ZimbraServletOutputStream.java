/**
 * A wrapper of ServletOutputStream that supports the Appendable interface.
 * 
 * We should avoid using a Writer when write to the response stream because:
 * 
 * 1. The Writer returned by HttpServletResponse.getWriter() is a PrintWriter.
 *    PrintWriter eats up IOException then turns on an error flag, and app 
 *    has to call PrintWriter.checkError() in order to detect any error on the wire.
 *    However, calling checkError() on each append() call is not practical, because 
 *    checkError() flushes whatever data in the buffer out to the wire each time 
 *    when it is called, as that is the only way to detect any connection errors.
 *    This is very inefficient.
 *    
 * 2. If we construct a BufferedWriter/OutputStreamWriter from the Stream(a ServletOutputStream)
 *    returned by HttpServletResponse.getOutputStream() and just use the append 
 *    methods of the Writer, then data is buffered in the Writer object and a 
 *    Writer.flush() is needed to flush any buffered data to the jetty's Stream after
 *    we have appended all our data.   The problem of invoking Writer.flush() is 
 *    that it will trigger OutputStream.flush() on the underling OutputStream, and 
 *    if Content-Length header is not set, the flush will interfere with jetty's 
 *    logic of determining whether to use http chunked transfer encoding in the response.  
 *    This is because when a flush() is invoked on jetty's OutputStream, jetty needs to first 
 *    complete and write out all the headers if it has not.  At this point,  jetty has no way 
 *    of knowing if this is the end of the response.  As a result, it has to assume there 
 *    is more data, and flushes the current data in the response buffer to the wire as a chunk.  
 *    This causes all responses, no matter how small it is, is always returned as chunked encoding
 *    (Transfer-Encoding: chunked, instead of setting a Content-Length), even it has only one 
 *    small chunk.  This will add extra overhead to http clients.  We want jetty to only chunk 
 *    large responses.
 *    
 * Our Element class outputs data using the Appendable interface methods.  
 * This wrapper implements the append methods by converting data to UTF-8 and 
 * write to the ServletOutputStream.  This way IOexception won't be eaten(problem of doing 1), 
 * and we don't interfere with jetty's process in deciding on the transfer encoding(problem of doing 2).
