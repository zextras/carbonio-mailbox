// Notebook feature and WikiItem are deprecated as of 7.0.0.  Briefcase
// and Documents are still supported and they can be used to store
// versioned rich text content as WikiItem.
//
// Documents are stored in the mailbox of the requestor.  The access to
// the Documents will be determined by ACL of the folder the Notes are 
// stored.  By default Documents are accesible to the account holder only, thus 
// private.  Documents can be shared (via changing the ACL of the Folder
// that contains Document) to other users, group, or to everyone.
// 

//
// General Document sync strategy
//
// Zimbra Documents are server side file storage.  It is possible to
// set up a sync client between Zimbra and another type of file storage
// mechanism, such as cloud or files on a disk.  The sync client should
// use the sync protocol described in sync.txt.  For Document sync, the 
// following approach can be made.
//
// - the Documents are stored in Folders with view set to document.
//   although the server can store mix of item in any given folder, it is
//   generally assumed the folders are also typed.
//
// - Downloading Document should use the REST interface for the Document.
//   http://{server}/home/{username}/Briefcase/{filename}      // by name
//   http://{server}/home/[~]{username}/?id={item-id}          // by id

//
// Search
// The contents and the filename of the Documents are indexed.  
// Use the existing Search API with "types" set to "document".
//

// Get
// through the rest URL:
//   http://{server}/home/{username}/Briefcase/{filename}      // by name
//   http://{server}/home/[~]{username}/?id={item-id}          // by id
//
