     * <br />{@code http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1939 - section 3. Basic Operation} talks about multi-line response
     * as follows:<br />
     *     Responses to certain commands are multi-line.  In these cases, which are clearly indicated below, after
     *     sending the first line of the response and a CRLF, any additional lines are sent, each terminated by a CRLF
     *     pair.  When all lines of the response have been sent, a final line is sent, consisting of a termination
     *     octet (decimal code 046, ".") and a CRLF pair.  If any line of the multi-line response begins with the
     *     termination octet, the line is "byte-stuffed" by pre-pending the termination octet to that line of the
     *     response. Hence a multi-line response is terminated with the five octets "CRLF.CRLF".  When examining a
     *     multi-line response, the client checks to see if the line begins with the termination octet.  If so and if
     *     octets other than CRLF follow, the first octet of the line (the termination octet) is stripped away.  If so
     *     and if CRLF immediately follows the termination character, then the response from the POP server is ended
     *     and the line containing ".CRLF" is not considered part of the multi-line response.
     *
     * i.e.  Any real data line that begins with "." should have been prefixed with a single "." in the response.
