     * bug 68820
     *
     * the grant cannot be inherited by sub-groups on the target side
     *   - can only be associated with dl/account/calresource rights, or combo rights
     *     containing any dl/account/calresource rights.
     *   - can only be granted on dl targets (it does not make sense to use this modifier
     *     on any other target types).
     *   - does not work with the + modifier.  i.e., grants made with the ^ modifier cannot
     *     be further granted to other delegated admins by the grantee of the grant.
     *   - not applicable for target side negation, because grants with this modifier
     *     are not visible to "sub-target" anyway.  In another words, grants with this
     *     modifier are automatically negated in all sub-targets.
     *     e.g. subDL is a member of DL
     *          user is a member of subDL
     *          => grants on DL are not visible on subDL and user.
     *
     *   This modifier disallows the grant to be inherited by sub groups
     *   - for dl rights, it means the grant only applies to the dl on which the grant
     *     is made, it is not effective on sub-groups
     *   - for account/calresource rights, it means the grant only applies to
     *     accounts/calresources that are direct member of the dl on which the grant
     *     is made.
     *
     *     e.g.
     *     DL has members:
     *        user
     *        subDL1
     *
     *     subDL1 has members:
     *        user1
     *        subDL2
     *
     *     subDL2 has members:
     *        user2
     *
     *     grants on DL:
     *         - adminA addDistributionListMember
     *         - adminA modifyAccount
     *         - adminB ^addDistributionListMember
     *         - adminB ^modifyAccount
     *
     *     Then,
     *     adminA can:
     *         - addDistributionListMember on DLs: DL, subDL1, subDL2
     *         - modifyAccount on accounts: user, user1, user2
     *
     *     adminB can:
     *         - addDistributionListMember on DLs: DL
     *         - modifyAccount on accounts: user
