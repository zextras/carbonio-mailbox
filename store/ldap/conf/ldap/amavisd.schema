#
# The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
# functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
# assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,

# Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
# to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible

# We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
# software, because free software needs free documentation: a free

# under copyright law.
#
# A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
# Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
# modifications and/or translated into another language.
#
# A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
# the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
# publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
# (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
# within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in part a
# textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
# mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
# connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
# commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
# them.
#
# The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
# are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
# that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
# section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
# allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
# Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
# Sections then there are none.
#
# The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
# as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
# the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
# be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
#
# A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
# represented in a format whose specification is available to the
# general public, that is suitable for revising the document
# straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
# pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
# drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
# for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
# to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
# format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
# or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
# An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
# of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
#
# Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
# ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
# or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
# HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
# transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
# include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
# proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
# processing tools are not generally available, and the
# machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
# processors for output purposes only.
#
# The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
# plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
# this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
# formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
# the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
# preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
#
# A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
# title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
# text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
# specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
# "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
# of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
# section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
#
# The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
# states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
# Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
# License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
# implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
# no effect on the meaning of this License.
#
#
# 2. VERBATIM COPYING
#
# You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
# commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
# copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
# to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
# conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
# technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
# copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
# compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
# number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
#
# You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
# you may publicly display copies.
#
#
# 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
#
# If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
# printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
# Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
# copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
# Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
# the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
# you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
# the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
# visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
# Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
# the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
# as verbatim copying in other respects.
#
# If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
# legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
# reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
# pages.
#
# If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
# more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
# copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
# a computer-network location from which the general network-using
# public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
# a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
# If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
# when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
# that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
# location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
# Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
# edition to the public.
#
# It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
# Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
# them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
#
#
# 4. MODIFICATIONS
#
# You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
# the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
# the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
# Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
# and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
# of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
#
# A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
#    from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
#    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
#    of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
#    if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
# B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
#    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
#    Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
#    Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
#    unless they release you from this requirement.
# C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
#    Modified Version, as the publisher.
# D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
# E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
#    adjacent to the other copyright notices.
# F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
#    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
#    terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
# G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
#    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
# H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
# I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
#    to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
#    publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
#    there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
#    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
#    given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
#    Version as stated in the previous sentence.
# J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
#    public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
#    the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
#    it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
#    You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
#    least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
#    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
# K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
#    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
#    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
#    and/or dedications given therein.
# L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
#    unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
#    or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
# M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
#    may not be included in the Modified Version.
# N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
#    or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
# O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
#
# If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
# appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
# copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
# of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
# list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
# These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
#
# You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
# nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
# parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
# been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
# standard.
#
# You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
# passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
# of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
# Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
# through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
# includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
# by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
# you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
# permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
#
# The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
# give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
# imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
#
#
# 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
#
# You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
# License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
# versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
# Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
# list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
# license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
#
# The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
# multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
# copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
# different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
# adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
# author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
# Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
# Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
#
# In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
# in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
# "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
# and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
# Entitled "Endorsements".
#
#
# 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
#
# You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
# released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
# License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
# the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
# verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
#
# You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
# it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
# License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
# other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
#
#
# 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
#
# A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
# and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
# distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
# resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
# of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
# When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
# apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
# derivative works of the Document.
#
# If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
# copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
# the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
# covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
# electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
# Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
# aggregate.
#
#
# 8. TRANSLATION
#
# Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
# distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
# Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
# permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
# translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
# original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
# translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
# Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
# the original English version of this License and the original versions
# of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
# the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
# or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
#
# If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
# "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
# its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
# title.
#
#
# 9. TERMINATION
#
# You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
# as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
# copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
# automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
# parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
# License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
# parties remain in full compliance.
#
#
# 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
#
# The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
# of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
# versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
# differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
# http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
#
# Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
# If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
# License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
# following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
# of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
# Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
# number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
# as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
