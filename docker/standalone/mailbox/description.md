This image contains the mailbox main process with some default configuration.

The default configuration works with specific network connections and container 
names.
For example, in order to have a working docker-compose setup, you need to 
define containers with these names:
- carbonio-ldap -> openldap 
- carbonio-mariadb -> mariadb
- carbonio-mariadb -> mariadb
